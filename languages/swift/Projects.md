# Projects 

## Interfaces
The "Interface" setting in Xcode’s new-project dialog lets you pick which UI framework your app will use—either SwiftUI for a declarative, code-driven interface or Storyboard for a UIKit-based, visual layout. 
### Storyboard
A storyboard is an Xcode Interface Builder file that provides a visual canvas for laying out your app’s scenes and view controllers—letting you drag-and-drop UI elements, define transitions, and connect views to their controllers to visualize interface flow.
### SwiftUI 
SwiftUI is Apple’s modern, declarative UI framework—introduced at WWDC 2019—that lets developers build interfaces across all Apple platforms using a reactive, code-driven syntax that automatically updates when state changes.

SwiftUI is generally preferred (over storyboard) for new projects thanks to its declarative syntax, live previews, and cross-platform consistency, whereas storyboards (UIKit) still see use for legacy apps and cases requiring mature ecosystem support.
