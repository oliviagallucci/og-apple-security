# Static Analysis

Static analysis is the subset of reverse engineering that involves examining code or binaries without execution. Objectives:

- Map control flow and logic  
- Identify potential vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, unsafe function calls)  
- Interpret disassembled or decompiled output  
- Extract strings, symbols and data structures  

## Examples

- Using IDA Pro for disassembly and decompilation  
- Running `otool` to inspect Mach-O headers  
- Employing `class-dump` to view Objective-C class structures
