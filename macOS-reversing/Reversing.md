# Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a compiled binary or system to understand its design, functionality and structure without access to source code or design documentation. Objectives: 

- Understand internal software mechanisms  
- Identify vulnerabilities for exploit development  
- Analyze malware  
- Modify program behavior (e.g., apply patches)  
- Research compatibility and interoperability

```

### Methodologies

- **Static analysis**: Examination of the binary without execution (disassembly, decompilation, file structure inspection)  
- **Dynamic analysis**: Execution and observation of runtime behavior, including API calls and memory usage  

### Tools

IDA Pro, Ghidra, Hopper, LLDB, Frida, DTrace
