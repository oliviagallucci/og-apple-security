# Debugging 

Debugging is the process of **finding and fixing bugs (errors) in code**. It involves:

- Running the program in a **debugger** (e.g., LLDB, GDB)
- Setting **breakpoints**
- Stepping through code line by line
- Inspecting variables, memory, registers, and stack
- Modifying execution flow temporarily to test behavior

**Main goal:** Fix functional or logical bugs in software you are developing or analyzing.
